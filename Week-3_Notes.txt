rm = remove file
rm -r = entire directory
mv = move
mv -r  = entire directory
echo = prints to screen

Types of Data Science questions:-
Descriptive
Goal: Describe a set of data
- The first kind of data nanalysis performd
- Commonly applied to census data
- The description and interpretation are different steps
- Descriptions can usually not be generated without additional statistical moelling

Exploratory
Goal: Find relationships you did not kow about
- Exploratory models are good for discovering new connections
- They are also useful for defining future studies
- Exploratory analysis are usually not the final say
- Explaoratory analysis alone (usually) should not be used for generalising/predicting
- Correlation DOES NOT imply causation

Iferential
Goal: Use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population
- Inference is commonly the goal of statistical models
- Inference involves estimating both the quantity you care about and your uncertainty about your estimate
- Inference depends heavi;ly on both the population and the sampling scheme

Predictive
Goal: To use the data on some objects to predict values for another object
- If X predicts Y it does not mean that X causes Y
- Accurate prediction depends heavily on measuring the right variables
- Although there are better and worse presdiction models, more data and a simple model works really well
- Prediction is very hard, especially about the future reference

Causal
Goal: To find out what happens to one variable when you ake another variable change
- Usually randomized studies are required to identify causation
- There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomised studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions
- Causal relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may not apply to every individual
- Causal models are usually the Gold' standard for data analysis

Mechanistic
Goal: Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects
- Incredibly hard to deliver, except in simple situations
- Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations(physical/engineering science)
- Generally the random component of the data is measurement error.
- If the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis
